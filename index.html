          Aerial hoop, also known as "Lyra", "Circeaux" or "Aerial Ring" is a
          form of exercise that only recently emerged. It has roots in the
          circus and the world of acrobatics and is related to both pole dance
          and aerial silk. It is an enlarged hula hoop ring of steel suspended
          from the ceiling, in which hoop artists can exercise trapeze skills
          like spins, drops, tricks, held poses and postures. In aerial hoop,
          you conduct the exercises in fast motions and you often practice
          rather long combinations. Tricks that can be performed include the
          Candlestick, Bird's Nest and Crescent Moon. Aerial hoops come in
          various sizes and variants and can either have single tab or double
          tab configurations for hanging. They can also be on a static, swinging
          or spinning setting. Start your journey and learn how to fly
